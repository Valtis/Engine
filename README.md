Engine
======

Simple 2d game engine. Will probably never be finished.
Created with Visual Studio 2012. While I haven't tested the code with any other compilers, I have tried to avoid any non-portable constructs (no guarantees though)

Libraries used:

SDL 2.0			http://www.libsdl.org/
Boost 1.54 		http://www.boost.org/
Lua 5.1			http://www.lua.org/
LuaBind 0.91	http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabind/
